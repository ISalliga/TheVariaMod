Varia is a general content mod, aiming to add amounts of content only your wildest dreams could think up... and will.

The mod currently adds:

- A new biome: the Cavity!
The Cavity is an area underground that has been affected by a plague that could even infect stone! It didn't spread very far, but it does hurt the environment a LOT, and if you're not careful, the mutant beasts that roam the Cavity may kill you... 
It's not like the risk/reward factor is lacking, however. There is an ore that forms in the Cavity - Cacitian - and it's quite hardy.

- Another new biome: the Everlasting Breeze!
An abandoned airborne wasteland, the Everlasting Breeze has seen no true life for decades. That's not to say that it has nothing to offer, however, as there is a special mirror there that will let you teleport freely among the world if you are worthy enough, as well as a strong mineral named Glistenyn and a station at which you can craft special potions.
It is however, still abandoned, and thus you will not find any combat there.

Two new pre-Hardmode boss: the Soul of the Guide and the Spider Queen!

Three new Hardmode bosses: the Fallen Angel, Nice Guy, and the Anomaly!

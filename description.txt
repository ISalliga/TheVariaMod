Varia is a general content mod, aiming to add amounts of unique content like your wildest dreams could think up... and will.

The mod currently adds:

- A new biome: the Cavity!
The Cavity is an area underground that has been affected by a plague that could even infect stone! It didn't spread very far, but it does hurt the environment a LOT, and if you're not careful, the mutant beasts that roam the Cavity may kill you... 
It's not like the risk/reward factor is lacking, however. There is an ore that forms in the Cavity, and it's quite hardy.

Two new Hardmode bosses: the Fallen Angel, and Nice Guy!
